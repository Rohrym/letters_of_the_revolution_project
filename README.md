# The Letters of the Revolution Project: An Inquiry Into the Correspondence Networks of the U.S. Founding Fathers.

This repository has been created as part of the *Letters of the Revolution* project which seeks to study the correspondence networks of the Founding Fathers of the United States with a social network analysis approach. The study is based on data obtained from [Founders Online](https://www.founders.archives.gov/) and [People of the Founding Era](https://pfe.rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/). 

Research question: How could we, through the use of Social Network Analysis, critically identify, describe and analyze the emergence of a new political founding elite in the wake of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783)?
